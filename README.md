A lot of the code for this is now commented out and can be revisited in the `old` branch.

Latest updates are on github pages & `nathan.tutchton.com`

make sure to `nvm use` and `nvm install` (it's on node 14)

to update:
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

I really need to throw this repo out rewrite this....
